* Introduction
  
  My first kaggle competion
  
  https://www.kaggle.com/c/liberty-mutual-group-property-inspection-prediction

  "In this challenge, your task is to predict a transformed count of
  hazards or pre-existing damages using a dataset of property
  information. This will enable Liberty Mutual to more accurately
  identify high risk homes that require additional examination to
  confirm their insurability."

  Main points:
  1. Predictors' names are NOT informative. So you cannot use
     insurance specific domain knowledge to improve the models. You
     can use only machine learning techniques.
  2. There are categorical variables that you have to factorize. It
     seems to do it in python is a little bit more complicated than in
     R.

  PS: (*DO NOT export this code*. When exporting all codes are
  executed and you will create ami instances)

  PS: You can set org-mode to do not execute the code during exporting set
  
  *TODO* Try to make code more safe by setting org export parameters in the header to prevent execute the code while exporting.

** Learning and developing Goals
   
   * Run models on AWS cloud service (EC2)
     1. Run the models exploring parallelism
     2. Develop literate devops (deployment) using Emacs
   * Learning popular python analytics libraries
   * Start learning new machine learning technique
     1. Gradient Boost Tree (Implementation XGBoost)
         
   https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost
         
* Exploratory phase

  We started with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get familiar with
  the data and start understanding the relations between predictors
  and the response variable. There are 33 columns and almost 51k rows
  in the training data. The Hazard column is the response (dependent)
  variable and it is an integer starting with 1. Many predictors
  (features) are categorical data but others are numerical data. In
  this competition there is no additional information about the data.

  To get a balcony view of the data, the histogram of the predictors
  was built and also the correlation matrix.
  
  [[file:figures/predictors_dashboards.png]]
  
  [[file:figures/corr_matrix.png]]

  PS: Shameless stolen from
  http://blog.kaggle.com/2015/09/28/liberty-mutual-property-inspection-winners-interview-qingchen-wang/
  
  We investigated the Hazard score and we discovered that Hazard score
  is extremely concentrated in the first’s levels. Almost 40% of the
  data has Hazards score equal to 1 and 80% of the data has Hazard
  score less than 7.
  
  [[file:figures/hazard_cumulative_hist.png]]
  
  [[file:figures/hazard_histogram.png]]

  In order to start reducing dimensionality using feature selection we
  used the relative importance plot of the first xgboost models and we
  eliminated few features based on that.
  
  #+begin_src python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import xgboost as xgb
    import libs.utils as utl
    import libs.exploratory as epl

    train_pre = pd.read_pickle("data/pre/train_pre.pkl")
    train_pre.Hazard.describe()

    epl.build_histogram_dashboard(train_pre)
    epl.build_corrmatrix_dashboard(train_pre)

    xgb_model_file = "submissions/20151021/xgb_model.bin"
    xgb_model = xgb.Booster({'nthread':3}) #init model
    xgb_model.load_model(xgb_model_file) # load data

    epl.build_xgb_features_importance_dashboard(xgb_model,train_pre)

  #+end_src
  
  [[file:figures/feature_importance_xgb.png]]
    
* Variable selection or Features engineering 
  
  The only thing we tried was factorize the columns (categorical
  columns):

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
      columns_to_factorize = [
                            'T1_V4', 'T1_V5', 'T1_V6', 'T1_V7', 'T1_V8',
                            'T1_V9', 'T1_V11', 'T1_V12', 'T1_V15', 'T1_V16',
                            'T1_V17', 'T2_V3', 'T2_V5', 'T2_V11', 'T2_V12',
                            'T2_V13'
                            ]
  #+END_SRC
  
  The other columns are numerical values. Since it was impossible to
  interpret the features based on their names and there are no
  explanations about every feature. But I should have tried few data
  transformations (That are going to be next steps in the next
  competition)

* The Model

  We worked only with Gradient Boosting
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting, because is
  technique that I was not familiar with. The GBM combines weaker
  classifiers in order to get a single strong classifier. In each
  interaction the 

  \begin{equation}
  F_{k+1}(\bold{x}) = F_{k}(\bold{x}) + h_{k}(\bold{x}) \nonumber
  \end{equation}


  is improved by the function $h_k(\bold{x})$. Like
  any other boosting methods, GBM learn by correcting its predecessor
  $F_k(\bold{x})$.
  
  We chose XGBoost which is a parallel implementation of GBM, because
  it is very popular in Kaggle competitions and allow us run GBM
  algorithms in parallel. The main points are summarized:
  * Usability
    * Easy to install (local and remote machine)
    * Easy to use in R and Python
  * Efficiency
    * Can explore parallelism
    * Can run in clusters and multithreads systems
    * Implemented in C/C++ (Double check this later)
  * Feasibility
    * Customized objective and evaluation function
    * Tunable parameters
       
  The parameters that we investigated during the competition were:

  * Controls complexity
    * gamma
    * max_depth
  * Robust to noise
    * subsample
    * colsample_bytree
    * num_round
  * Optimization related
    * eta: controls the learning rate (It can help to prevent
      overfitting)

  We randomly split the data in train (70%) and validation data (30%)
  and we tried different parameters for eta, max_depth and
  num_rounds. We use rmse as a metric to train the model but also we
  monitor the gini metric in the validation data set. An important
  property of the gini metric is that only the order of the prediction
  matters.

  We started by modifying the [[https://www.kaggle.com/titericz/liberty-mutual-group-property-inspection-prediction/done-done-3/code.][start kit]]. We observed a significant
  increase in our score when we chose *count:poisson* as objective
  because it is natural choice. The response variable was integer
  (counting data)
  
* Set AMI instance on AWS EC2

  The AWS services provide us (data scientist) access to clusters,
  computers with big memory, powerful GPUs and distributed systems
  with low price thanks to the hardware as commodity business
  model. Of course there are more reasons and inclusive more important
  than those cited (Reliability and Scalability) that is not scope of
  this document.
  
  I started exploring the service known as Elastic Compute Cloud
  EC2. EC2 allows us to run a virtual machine or cluster of virtual
  machines on the cloud and you can scale up or down according with
  your necessity.

  I installed the command line AWS cli tools on my local machine
  (https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). I found a interesting blog
  (http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html) about
  how to deploy my code using Emacs + org-mode
  (org-babel:http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/). The process
  is known as literate +programming+ deployment. This make the life
  really easy, because automatizes the entire process to deploy the
  code on aws cloud service and also provide a better documentation of
  the entire deployment process. Also Emacs has a nice mode called
  TRAMP that can be used to edit remote files like a local file
  (http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode).

  To avoid reinvent the wheel and simplify the entire process, we
  start by choosing the ami with the criteria ranked by priority
  below:
  
  1. *Total Cost*: < USD 10
  2. #cpu : [8 ,16]
  3. Memory RAM: 2GB
  4. Sytems similar to development environment (my local machine)
     1. with pre-installed tools:
	1. python and pip (same version or similar of my local
           machine)
	2. scikit-learn, pandas and numpy
	3. jason and zipfile
	4. command make
     2. Easy to install xgboost
  5. Storage: 8GB (The minimum will be enough)
  6. Networking requirements: low
     
  Instances candidates:
  1. m3.2xlarge
     1. #cpu: 8
     2. RAM: 30 GB
     3. pricing: 0.616/hour => 16h
  2. m4.2xlarge
     1. #cpu: 8
     2. RAM: 32 GB
     3. pricing: 0.588/hour => 17h
  3. *c1.xlarge* old generation instance
     1. #cpu: 8
     2. RAM: 7 GB
     3. pricing: 0.478/hour => 21h
	
  Based on the criteria, we chose the community ami instance
  (*Compute-Optimized*) anaconda-2.3.0-on-ubuntu-14.04-lts
  -ami-31b27375 (Thanks to anaconda project:
  http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/images). Compute-Optimized
  instances have a higher ratio of vCPUs to memory than other families
  and the *lowest cost per vCPU* of all the Amazon EC2 instance
  types. Our budget with this instance allows us to play 21h in aws
  cloud. :)

  To access the web interface use the link below and if you need to
  create a new key pair use the instructions below.

  1. Login aws console:
     https://xxxxxxxxxxxx.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
  2. To use aws console web interface to create the key pair (Case you
     don't have it).
     * create and download key pair: key.perm
     * move key.perm to .ssh/
     * change the permission: chmod 400
       key.perm

  Run it only if you don’t have the key pair yet.
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :session
   mv -v ~/Downloads/key.perm ~/.ssh/
   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/key.perm
  #+END_SRC

  The deployment process will be explained in the next sections. You
  can run the code inside the emacs with C-c C-c or you can use emacs
  to build and save

* Comparing run time local machine vs aws instance 
  
  *My local machine configuration*

  * Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
  * Processor: 4x Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz
  * RAM Memory : 6012MB
  * #cpus: 4
  
  To make sure that run the code in the ec2 instance is worthwhile, we
  change the number of trees (num_round) and we executed the code with
  different numbers of thread in the remote and local machine. We
  conclude that we have significant gain in time performance when we
  execute xgboost in the cloud with 6 numbers threads and the number
  num_round is greater than 500 in our configuration. See the graph
  below with the comparative.

  [[file:figures/benchmark_remote_local.png]]

  Legend:
  * Rem thr N: executed  in ec2 instance with N threads
  * Loc thr N: executed in local machine with N threads

  The image above is the output of the command htop and It shows our
  algorithms running in parallel using 7 cpu units.

* Analysing leaderboard scores

  In order to assess my relative performance and plan my next steps
  and strategy, we conducted a brief analysis of the scores of the
  leaderboards competition and also the scores which I found on the
  internet.
  
  The table below summarizes scores that I found on internet. The
  difference of my best score and the winner score is only 2.2%, but I
  did only 18 submissions (The winner did 232 submissions) because of
  the amount of time that I had to spend on the competition. This
  suggest that I have to spend much much more time to have any chance
  to win a competition or at least end in the 25% tail.

  The histogram below shows a comparative between the private scores
  distributions of all kaggle competitors and my public and private
  score.

  [[file:figures/hist_private_scores.png]]

  In this competition, the private Gini metric of my model was bigger
  than in the public leaderboard. My score is located in the left side
  of the mode of the histogram. So, we calculated private score
  improvement metric by subtracting public score from the private one
  and then we investigated how much the scores changed between the
  public and private leaderboards.
    
  [[file:figures/boxplot_pub_scores_vs_drank.png]]    

  We noted that almost half of the top 25 in the public score were
  able to improve their rank in the private leaderboard, but in
  general the rank in public leaderboard can be very different from
  private leaderboard. See the boxplot.

  The scatterplot below shows the relations of gini scores improvement
  and rank improvement. We selected the top 100 submissions in the
  private leaderboard for this analysis.
    
  [[file:figures/scatter_drank_vs_dscore.png]]

  Few kaggler actually reduced their gini score in the top 100 private
  leaderboard. We were located in the upper right quadrant, where
  kagglers increased their private score but lost position in the
  leaderboard. Their neighbors in the public leaderboard were able to
  increase more their scores. The winner increased a little his score
  to gain one position and end the competition in first place. In the
  data it seems to have few clusters that might be related with
  similar type of models or approaches and you can see the pattern
  that large improvements in score can lead to better rank
    
* Time Table

  Thanks to Emacs and orgmode ([[http://orgmode.org/]]) We were able to
  track the time I spent in every task. The tasks on this project were
  classified:

  * DOC (28%): Time spent writing documentation and taking notes
  * MODELLING (20%): Time spent analyzing, modeling and planning the next steps
  * DATA (3%): Time spent in preparing the data for analysis
  * PROG (26%): Time spent implementing and refactoring the code
  * STUDY (23%): Time spent studying libraries and machine learning’s
    algorithms

  [[file:figures/time_spent.png]]
 
  It is interesting to note, thanks to Kaggle's good job, I only spent
  3% of the time preparing the data. Normally, I spend 60% up to 80%
  of the time with data processing: acquiring, decide which data to
  collect or use, preparing, cleaning and dealing with missing values.

  It is clear the necessity to save code for the next competitions and
  I expect as the amount of time I spend studying will be
  worthwhile. The majority of the time writing was spent after the end
  of the competition and I believe it is very important.

  PS: *This is a roughly estimation but useful for planning*
  
* Conclusion

  In general kaggle competitions is a good way to learn, try and test
  new machine learning algorithms.

  * What I haven't used 
    * I should have used Cross Validation: Grid Search or Randomized
      Search to tune up parameters and save time
    * I should have spent more time designing training data and
      validation data. It is good to have data validation similar as
      test data (submission)
    * I should have tried ensemble model
      * Bagging or 
      * Boosting or 
      * Stacking (Blending)
    * In the real data analysis where interpretability is extremely
      important, I would have spent more time in exploratory phase and
      variable selection. I still believe that might have contributed
      to reach better results
  * Goals and What I learned
    * Run the algorithms on AWS cloud is cheaper and can save a lot of
      time
    * Set AWS instances can be facilitated a lot by using literate
      deployment with Emacs and org-babel.
    * Development the algorithm in python was not so difficult than I
      was expecting. (I normally use R for these tasks). The first
      thing that I noticed is that work with categorical data is
      easier in R.
    * Keep organized and track all your tries are extremely important
    * Gradient Boosting is a powerful technique and also can be used
      as feature selection (relative importance)
    * Kaggle competition, blogs and forums is a good way to train and
      apply machine learning algorithms
    * It is important to understand the evaluation metric.
      
* Note from references

  I used a lot of information from others blogs. I tried to cite
  everything, but I confessed that during my annotation I lost a lot
  of my sources. So, if you see something that came from other site
  and it was not cited and you felt wronged, please let me know I will
  do my best to include all references.

** Pragmatic programming principles

   1. DRY: Do not repeat yourself
   2. Write shy code n Design by Contratc n Test Unit in mind
   3. Decoupling n Law of Demeter
      1. The Law of Demeter for functions states that any method of an
         object can call only methods belongs to:
	 1. itself
	 2. parameter that was passed in to the method
	 3. any object it created
	 4. any direct held component objects
   4. Write code that writes code (Yasnippet)

** Generates TAGS

   Steps:
   1. M-x ess-build-tags-for-directory
      1. Select folde (Rcode)
      2. Select fiel TAG
   2. visit-tags-table (update hash)
   3. M-. visit tag (while point in function call)

   Unfortunately, these programs do not recognize R code syntax. They do
   allow tagging of arbitrary language files through regular expressions,
   but this is not sufficient for R.

   R 2.9.0 onwards provides the rtags function as a tagging utility for R
   code. It parses R code files (using R's parser) and produces tags in
   Emacs' etags format.

   To update you can use:
   M-x visit-tags-table (select tag table)

   M-. = visit tag (Go to function definition)

   M-x ess-build-tags-for-directory run the shel script below for you
   Ask the directory to run rtags n then ask for file to save (TAGS)

    #+begin_src R
      ## Generate TAGS file
      rtags(path="Rcode/",recursive = TRUE,verbose=TRUE,ofile = "TAGS")
    #+end_src

   Nao parece funcionar com ggtags (mode para tarbalhar com tags no emacs)
